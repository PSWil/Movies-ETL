# Movies-ETL
## Overview
For this project I was asked to gather movie data from wikipedia and kaggle and create a database for students to use in order to preform there own analysis durring a Hackathon. To accomplish this I extracted the data from Wikipedia and Kaggle and used python's pandas library to transform the data into a dataframe. Then I loaded it to PostgreSQL for students use in the Hackathon.
